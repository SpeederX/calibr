# Architecture and working methodology

How the project is organized and how changes flow from idea to release.

## Branching: GitFlow lite

Two long-lived branches:

- `master` — released, tagged, stable. Every commit on master is reachable
  from a release tag.
- `dev` — integration branch. New work lands here first.

Short-lived branches off `dev`:

- `feat/<short-slug>` — new feature or behavior change.
- `chore/<short-slug>` — refactor, doc-only, infra, no behavior change.

Both merge back to `dev` via PR after CI passes.

Short-lived branches off `master`:

- `hotfix/<short-slug>` — urgent fix for a released version. Merges to
  `master` (with a new patch tag) AND back into `dev` to keep them aligned.

```
   master  ──●─────●─────●──────●────────●─────●──    tags v0.1.0, v0.1.1, v0.2.0, ...
              \           \             /     /
   hotfix      ─●─       hotfix         ─●──●
                          \                /
   dev    ──●─●─●─●─●───●─●─●─●───────●─●─●─●──
              \   \     /         \         /
   feat        ●   ●───●           ●───────●
```

## Versioning: semantic, prefixed `v`

`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

| Bump  | Trigger                                   | Examples |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| MAJOR | Breaking change to CLI, config schema, or output format | rename a subcommand, remove a flag, change `samples.json` schema |
| MINOR | New feature, backwards compatible         | new subcommand, new flag, new report column |
| PATCH | Fix only, no new behavior                 | crash fix, regex correction, doc-only typo fix |

Features accumulate on `dev` and ship as a MINOR when we cut a release.
Hotfixes go straight to `master` and ship as a PATCH on top of the latest tag.

### Pre-public flexibility

While the project is offline (no public remote, no external users),
breaking changes are allowed at MINOR bumps even after v1.0.0. SemVer
2.0 already allows this freely in the `0.x.y` range; we extend the
permission to `1.x.y` while we have no consumers to protect. Once the
project is published (GitHub remote, external users, package
registry), strict SemVer applies: every breaking change becomes
MAJOR.

This is not an excuse to break things capriciously — every break
still gets a release note and a migration path. It is permission to
keep iterating on the schema and vocabulary while there is no one
downstream to inconvenience.

## Typical work cycle

1. Open or write a small **spec** in `spec/` describing the desired behavior.
2. Open or update a **plan** in `plans/` describing how to implement it.
3. Branch off `dev` (or `master` for hotfix), implement, add or update tests.
4. Open PR. CI runs tests. After approval, squash-merge into `dev`.
5. When ready to release, merge `dev` → `master` and tag `vX.Y.Z`. The tag
   triggers any release automation (TBD; see ROADMAP).

## Spec vs plan

- **Spec** is small, one feature or one decision. *What* should happen, with
  acceptance criteria. May fit under a single user-visible behavior
  (e.g. "config detect <key> behavior").
- **Plan** is bigger, often spans multiple specs or covers a coordinated set
  of changes. *How* we'll get there: file paths, ordering, verification
  steps, trade-offs considered.

A plan typically references one or more specs. A spec is implementable on
its own; a plan is an execution recipe.

## Decision rationale

Design choices live under `architecture/design/`. Each is a short doc with
**Why**, **Pros**, **Cons**, and a **Takeaway** that's empirical when
possible (measured numbers, not just speculation). When we make a non-trivial
choice (e.g. "use User PATH instead of a PowerShell module"), it gets a
file there before the change merges.

UX flows live under `architecture/ux/`. Each is the functional walk-through
of one use case (first-time install, bench cycle, config management, etc.)
written from the user's perspective: "the user types X, sees Y, then…".

## Domain glossary

`architecture/domain.md` is the authoritative source for project
vocabulary (lineage / series / model / variant / run config, plus
WDDM / saturation / headroom / winner / backend, etc.). New code,
specs, and docs MUST use the terms in the sense defined there. If a
term diverges, update `domain.md` first, then the code.

## Memory snapshots

`memories/memory-N.md` files (numbered 1, 2, 3, ...) freeze the
state of the project at chosen moments — typically before a context
compaction or a significant hand-off. Each is a stand-alone primer:
an LLM (or human) starting from one should be able to resume the
work without prior history.

Conventions:

- One file per snapshot, named `memory-<N>.md`. Increment monotonically.
- Higher numbers are more recent; treat older files as historical, not
  authoritative.
- Each snapshot includes: date, version, active branch, methodology
  recap, recent timeline, open work, reading-order pointers, caveats.
- Take a snapshot when: about to compact a long agent conversation;
  about to hand off to another contributor; just before a major
  release; whenever the in-flight context is rich enough that losing
  it would hurt.

The root `README.md` points readers (and LLMs) at this file plus
`memory-N.md` as the entry points to "what is this project, where is
it going."
